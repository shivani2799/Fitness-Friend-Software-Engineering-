freetime to notify the user to workout

graphical analysis of weekly workouts, and motivates user to set and reach
weight goals

### Authentication

The user is given the option to login with a premade account within the Firebase
Database or signup for an account. For testing purposes, an example of an account
connected to the database is: email: ​test@test.com​, password: password. Logging in
with this information will match with the information found in the Database folder.
However, you can create a new account and it will work the same.

### Calendar Sync

Once a user is logged in, the user clicks on the Calendar option. This leads them to the
calendar page.
The Calendar page will initially be blank with only the toggle notification dropdown
menu, save button, and back button showing. Once the user toggles free time
notifications to be on, they will be shown the dropdown menus for the free time
preferences - start time, end time, workout time needed, and notify time. Once the user
updates these preferences, they will need to press the save button in order for their
preferences to be saved in the Firebase real-time database. Additional buttons will also
appear that will allow the user to log into their Google account, to sync their Google
calendar, and navigate to the notification timer page, where they can see the time in


which they can expect the system to notify them again, if enough free time is available
within their pre-set interval.
If the user presses the Google Authentication button, the user will be directed to the
Google specific login website. Here, they can log into their pre-existing Google account,
allowing them to sync their Google calendar with the app, removing the need of
inputting events manually.
**Note: Currently, Snack Expo does not support the Google Calendar API as it is
not one of the npms they have pre-installed within their software. Because of this,
we were unable to utilize the Google Calendar feature within our integrated
Snack. In addition to this, Google only hands out specific web keys needed in
order to use their Google Authentication system on a mobile device. Because of
this, unless you are using a web app, the Google Authentication page will not
appear when this button is pressed.
If the user presses the Notification Timer button, the user will be directed to a page that
will show a countdown. This countdown indicates the time in which they can expect the
system to notify them again, if enough free time is available within their pre-set interval.
Once the countdown reaches zero, the system will check again to see if there is
enough free time needed to implement a workout within the pre-set free time interval. If
there is enough free time within the free time interval, the user will be notified by means
of a push notification.
**Note: More information can be found within the Calendar README file

### Calorie Tracker

Once a user is logged in, the user clicks on the Calorie Tracker option. This leads them
to our Homescreen.
The Homescreen displays the user’s calorie intake for the day at the top of the screen
and displays graphs as the bottom of the screen to show the user’s activity. In the
middle of the screen, there is an Input Food button, an Input Exercise button, and an
Input Goals button.
If the user presses the Input Food option, the user will be directed to a page that
contains two search bars. The user can search for the food they consumed by using the
food name or the UPC Barcode Number. Once they have found the correct food item,
the user can specify the quantity consumed. The calories are then calculated and added
to the Calorie Tracker.


```
If the user presses the Input Exercise button, the user will be directed to a menu-style
page with exercise options. Once the user selects the exercise type, they will be
prompted to enter the duration of the exercise and the date the exercise was completed.
The information will be used to calculate the number of calories burned during the
workout, and this information along with the date completed will be submitted to the
database.
If the user presses the Input Goals button, the user will be directed to a similar page as
the Exercise page, but with prompts about the user’s goals. They will be allowed to
input their gender, weight, goal--either gaining or losing weight, and their desired
amount of pounds to gain or lose. Once the user submits this information, it will be sent
to the database. When the user updates this information, if the user meets their goal,
they will be prompted with an alert that they met their goal.
*Note: When inputting data, the user will have to press the button twice for the
information to send to the database. This is due to the setState not changing on time.
**Note: More information can be found within the Calorie Tracker README file
```
### Music Curator

```
Spotify Authorization:
We used the OAuth function to create a connection with the Spotify account of
every User. The user will click on the login button and will be redirected to Spotify
website.
There they can login using their user id, email or facebook. After logging in the
user is redirected back to our app. Now, their Spotify account is synched with our
app.
Playlist creator:
After the user syncs their account without app, the user can now select an
exercise they want to do. They can also select the genre of music and how long
they want to exercise. This data will be passed to the Spotify app and a new
playlist will be created for the user. The user can listen to this playlist on Spotify
while exercising.

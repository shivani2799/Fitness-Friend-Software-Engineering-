Spotify Authorization:
	We used the OAuth function to create a connection with the Spotify account of every User. 
	The user will click on the login button and will be redirected to Spotify website. 
	There they can login using their user id, email or facebook. After logging in the 
	user is redireted back to our app. Now, their Spotify account is synched with our app. 

Playlist creator:
	After the user synchs their account withour app, the user can now select an exercise they 
	want to do. They can also select the genre of music and how long they want to exercise. 
	This data will be passed to the Spotify app and a new playlist will be created for the
	user. The user can listen to this playlist on Spotify while exercising.
